## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors determine and specify positions within the text where matches occur, the most commonly used anchors are "^", matching at the start of a line, and "$" matching at the end of a line.

* "*": Matches zero or more occurrences.
* +: Matches one or more occurrences.

* {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences.
* {n,}: Matches n or more occurrences.
* {n,m}: Matches between n and m occurrences.
