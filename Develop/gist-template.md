## Summary

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors determine and specify positions within the text where matches occur, the most commonly used anchors are "^", matching at the start of a line, and "$" matching at the end of a line.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are used to specify hows many times a particular element or group occurs, common examples for quantifiers include :

* "*": Matches zero or more occurrences.
* +: Matches one or more occurrences.
* ?: Matches zero or one occurrence.
* {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences.
* {n,}: Matches n or more occurrences.
* {n,m}: Matches between n and m occurrences.
### OR Operator
OR operators are used in regular expressions to match patterns. It's represented by a vertical bar "|" character. When used in a regex pattern, it will match the left or right side, an example of this would be rainy|sunny.
### Character Classes
Character classes are used to define a set of characters that will match
